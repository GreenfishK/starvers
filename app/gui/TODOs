Task 2:
Distinguish between days were the service was not running and days when there were no inserts. Use colors or symbols to display this in the plot.

Task 3:
Add information about the inserts and deletes (metrics) in a side view or different tab:
* number of distinct classes
* number of added instances per class in the delta set
* number of instances with no class
* number of distinct dobject properties
* number of distinct data properties
* change ratio between two versions (BEAR)
    * $\delta_{i,j} = \frac{|\Delta⁺_{i,j} \cup \Delta⁻_{i,j}|}{|IC_i \cup IC_j|}$
    * $\delta⁺_{i,j} = \frac{|\Delta⁺_{i,j}|}{|IC_i|}$
    * $\delta⁻_{i,j} = \frac{|\Delta⁻_{i,j}|}{|IC_i|}$
    * positive and negative change ratios can be part of the tooltip/hovertemplate on individual bars on the insert/delete trace
* data growth  (BEAR)
    * $growth = \frac{|IC_j|}{|IC_i|}$
    * can be part of the tooltip/hovertemplate on individual points on the total triples trace
* static core (BEAR)
    * $C_A$ : take the first version and applying all the subsequent deletions.
* total version-oblivious triples  (BEAR)
    * $O_A$: number of different triples regardless of the timestamp

Task 5: Add an info when the text polling will take place.
