# Starvers
Starvers is a python module for timestamp-based versioning of RDF data. It enables the creation of temporal knowledge graphs and ontologies with the possibility to query arbitrary snapshots of these datasets as they were at a specific point in time. 

The module leverages sparql-star's and rdf-star's nested triples paradigm to automatically decorate normal triples with creation and deletion timestamps. SPARQL insert or delete statements are transformed into temporal SPARQL-star queries. Additionally, we provide a generic update function that allows to overwrite a set of valid triples with another set of equal length. SPARQL queries are transformed into temporal SPARQL-star queries by parsing the user SPARQL query into a query tree, inserting the necessary temporal extensions as nodes at the right positions in the tree and parsing the tree back into a query. As timestamps are intrinsic properties of these datasets, porting them to any RDF-star triple store which supports multilevel nesting is made possible. An example for multilevel nesting would be `<< <<?s ?p ?o>> ?x ?y >> ?a ?b`.
In the following we will guide you through the installation process and give examples of how the offered functions should used to operate on an RDF dataset.

# Installation
Clone the repository and run `pip install .` 
# Example usage
For every operation we need to create a constructor and setup a connection to a triple store that supports multilevel nesting with RDF-star and SPARQL-star, such as GraphDB. 

```
from starvers.starvers import TripleStoreEngine

get_endpoint = "http://your-machine:7200/repositories/your-repository"
post_endpoint = "http://your-machine:7200/repositories/your-repository/statements"
engine = TripleStoreEngine(get_endpoint, post_endpoint)

```

## Version all rows - initialize dataset
First, we need to initialize our dataset and wrap every triple with a valid\_from and a valid\_until timestamp. Consider following example RDF dataset:

| Subject      | Predicate | Object |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| <http://example.com/Obama> | <http://example.com/occupation> |<http://example.com/President> |
| <http://example.com/Hamilton> | <http://example.com/occupation> | <http://example.com/Formel1Driver> |

Now we can choose whether we want to timestamp the data with the execution timestamp or with a custom one. For this example, we chose a custom timestamp in order to make the example reproducible. By executing ...
```
initial_timestamp = datetime(2022, 10, 12, 14, 43, 21, 941000, timezone(timedelta(hours=2)))
engine.version_all_rows(initial_timestamp)
# alternatively: engine.version_all_rows()
```
... our dataset turns into:

| Subject      | Predicate | Object |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| << << <http://example.com/Obama> <http://example.com/occupation> <http://example.com/President> >> https://github.com/GreenfishK/DataCitation/versioning/valid_from "2022-10-12T14:43:21.941000+02:00"^^xsd:dateTime >> | https://github.com/GreenfishK/DataCitation/versioning/valid_until | "9999-12-31T00:00:00.000+02:00"^^xsd:dateTime |
| << << <http://example.com/Hamilton> <http://example.com/occupation> <http://example.com/Formel1Driver> >> https://github.com/GreenfishK/DataCitation/versioning/valid_from "2022-10-12T14:43:21.941000+02:00"^^xsd:dateTime >> | https://github.com/GreenfishK/DataCitation/versioning/valid_until | "9999-12-31T00:00:00.000+02:00"^^xsd:dateTime |

## Insert new triples
To insert new triples we first need to prepare a list of triples and then pass them to the insert function. The triples must already be in n3 syntax, i.e. in case of an IRI, include the pointy brackets < > in the string.

```
new_triples = ['<http://example.com/Brad_Pitt> <http://example.com/occupation> <http://example.com/Limo_Driver> .',
               '<http://example.com/Frank_Sinatra> <http://example.com/occupation> <http://example.com/Singer> .']
engine.insert(new_triples)
```

## Update triples
To update triples we need to provide two lists of triples - one with the triples to be updated and one with the new values. Essentially, these are two nx3 matrices where one gets overriden by the other. If a value should not be updated None should be simply passed to the new matrix on the desired position. In the following example we are updating the subject position in the first triple and the object position in the second triple.

```
engine.update(
old_triples=[['<http://example.com/Obama>', '<http://example.com/occupation>' ,'<http://example.com/President>'],
             ['<http://example.com/Brad_Pitt>', '<http://example.com/occupation>', '<http://example.com/Limo_Driver>']],
new_triples=[['<http://example.com/Donald_Trump>', None, None],
             [None, None, '<http://example.com/Actor>']])

```

## Delete (Outdate) triples
To outdate triples we need to provide a list of valid triples which should be deleted. The valid_until timestamp of any matched triple will be replaced by the current system timestamp of python's datetime.now() function.
```
engine.outdate(['<http://example.com/Donald_Trump> <http://example.com/occupation> <http://example.com/President> .'])
```


## Query actual or historical data
To query actual data we just need to pass the query as a string ... 

```
query = """
PREFIX vers: <https://github.com/GreenfishK/DataCitation/versioning/>

SELECT ?person ?occupation {
    ?person <http://example.com/occupation> ?occupation .
}
"""
```
... to the query function. 
```
actual_snapshot = engine.query(query)
print(actual_snapshot)
```
Result set:
| person       | occupation |
| ----------- |  ----------- |
| <http://example.com/Hamilton> | <http://example.com/Formel1Driver> |
| <http://example.com/Brad_Pitt> | <http://example.com/Actor> |
| <http://example.com/Frank_Sinatra> | <http://example.com/Singer> |

To query historical data we additionally need to pass a timestamp. Here we chose the initial timestamp when we versioned our dataset for the first time ([see above](#version-all-rows---initialize-dataset)).
```
snapshot_timestamp = initial_timestamp
historical_snapshot = engine.query(query, snapshot_timestamp)
print(historical_snapshot)
```
Result set:
| person       | occupation |
| ----------- |  ----------- |
| <http://example.com/Obama> | <http://example.com/President> |
| <http://example.com/Hamilton> | <http://example.com/Formel1Driver> |
